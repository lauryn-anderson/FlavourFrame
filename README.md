# FlavourFrame

FlavourFrame is an iOS app for representing one’s perception during mindful tasting experiences. 
Each unique Flavour is represented visually with a drawing, and words can be added for annotation. 
To give more structure to these drawings, a Frame can be used and reused as a customized background image.

## Purpose

FlavourFrame is a prototype tool created during a summer 2023 research project at the University of Calgary. 
This research was supervised by Wesley Willett and Lora Oehlberg and funded by an 8-week PURE award. 
The prototype aims to realize design principles identified during a semester-long research course in winter 2023, 
including being deeply customizable and valuable for both novice and expert tasters. 

## Usage

To try the app, sit down with a food or drink, and draw what you perceive as you taste it. 
Does it remind you of other foods? Can you break down the amount of sourness, sweetness, saltiness, or other flavours? 
Does the overall flavour remind you of a shape or a sound or a colour?

## Implementation

This project was coded in Xcode 14 for iOS 16, targeting usage on iPad with Apple Pencil. 

There are many known issues, including:
- It is tricky to dismiss the keyboard after adding words. Try tapping the arrow button.
- If a word is dragged too far to the left, it’s hard or impossible to retrieve. No good workaround. Rest in peace.
- On iPhone, the buttons for drawing tools are usually inaccessible. Sorry about that. You’ll have to turn the phone sideways.
